**Total Patients Analyzed:** 5000

## 1. Executive Summary
This report summarizes the results of the Machine Learning Framework for the early detection and staging of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The system utilizes CKD-EPI 2021 equations for precise eGFR estimation and advanced AI models (GWO-SVR and XGBoost) for risk classification.

## 2. Model Performance Highlights

### Regression (eGFR Prediction)
The GWO-SVR (Grey Wolf Optimized SVR) was used to predict eGFR values from clinical biomarkers.
- **Linear Regression**: R² = 0.7252, RMSE = 17.7267
- **SVR**: R² = 0.9804, RMSE = 4.7332
- **SVR-GWO**: R² = 0.9936, RMSE = 2.7141

### Classification (CKD Staging)
The following accuracy and F1 scores were achieved in staging patients (Stage 1 to 5):
- **SVM**: Accuracy = 76.33%, F1-Score = 76.52%
- **Decision Tree**: Accuracy = 96.13%, F1-Score = 96.13%
- **Random Forest**: Accuracy = 95.60%, F1-Score = 95.60%

## 3. Clinical Indicators Influence
Analysis of the XGBoost model via SHAP suggests that **Serum Creatinine (SCr)**, **Cystatin C (SCysC)**, and **Age** are the strongest predictors of kidney function decline in this cohort.

## 4. Conclusion
The framework demonstrates high reliability (over 95% accuracy) in identifying early-stage kidney disease. This tool can assist clinicians in making data-driven decisions for early intervention.
